# Multi-User-Chat-System
In this project, I created a multi-user chat system in Linux, where the user can chat with one or multiple other users together (like a group chat).
It mainly utilizes the sigintHandler() and receive() function to create the connection between clients and it also has specific commands without which the chat won't start. 
Overall, this project enabled me to get greater insight and experience in using Linux and provided me the opportunity to become better in using the OG Linux commands.
